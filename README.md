rAthena - Ragnarok Online Emulator - NPC Scripts

Previously my scripts for rAthena an Ragknarok Online Server Emulator were hosted on the Google Code Project, 
but since it gets disbanded in 2016 I moved to Github.com.

Normally I only write NPC Scripts, while I'm also familiar with adding Custom Items to the database.
